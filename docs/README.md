## Connectors

The GND pin's location is marked on the board. The pins are in the same order as on the connected modules, **except for the encoders**, where the power pins are swapped.

## Debugging

The microcontroller has a Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface, which can be used with an external debugger, like an ST-Link or the ST-Link part of a Nucleo development board. The SWD connector is located between the LCD and the motor driver module. It has the following pinout:

The pinout is the same as the STM Nucleo boards' SWD connector pinout, so it can be directly connected like this:

In order to use the ST-Link part of the Nucleo with an external microcontroller, the `CN2` jumpers have to be removed. You can put them on sideways so you don't lose them:

**Note: The debugger can not / should not power the board, so the batteries have to be connected!**

The STM32CubeIDE should automatically detect the ST-Link. Use the upload/debug buttons on the top bar to flash and/or debug the firmware.
