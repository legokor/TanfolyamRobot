# DRV8833 module

This is a carrier board for the DRV8833 dual H-bridge motor driver chip. It is a drop-in replacement for the cheap chinese 12 pin version.

Improvements:
 * Current sense resistors for the chip's current limiter feature
 * More capacitance on the power rail
 * Fault LED
 * Active-high fault output (still open-collector)
